# vimux

Easily interact with tmux from vim. This project is still in development, so some features are still missing.

## Installation

With **[vim-bundle](https://github.com/benmills/vim-bundle)**: `vim-bundle install benmills/vimux`

Otherwise download the latest [tarball](https://github.com/benmills/vimux/tarball/master), extract it and move `plugin/vimux.vim` inside `~/.vim/plugin`. If you're using [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), then move the entire folder extracted from the tarball into `~/.vim/bundle`.

## Usage

### RunVimTmuxCommand
Run a system command in a small horizontal split bellow the current pane vim is in.

```viml
" Run the current file with rspec
map <Leader>rb :call RunVimTmuxCommand("clear; rspec " . bufname("%"))<CR>
```

### PromptVimTmuxCommand
Prompt for a command and run it in a small horizontal split bellow the current pane.

```viml
" Prompt for a command to run
map <Leader>rp :PromptVimTmuxCommand<CR>
```

### RunLastVimTmuxCommand
Run the last command executed by `RunVimTmuxCommand`

```viml
" Run last command executed by RunVimTmuxCommand
map <Leader>rl :call RunLastVimTmuxCommand<CR>
```

### InspectVimTmuxRunner
Move into the tmux runner pane created by `RunVimTmuxCommand` and enter copy mode (scroll mode).

```viml
" Inspect runner pane
map <Leader>ri :InspectVimTmuxRunner<CR>
```

### CloseVimTmuxWindows
Close all other tmux panes in the current window.

```viml
" Close all other tmux panes in current window
map <Leader>rx :CloseVimTmuxWindows<CR>
```

### InterruptVimTmuxRunner
Interrupt any command that is running inside the runner pane.

```viml
" Interrupt any command running in the runner pane
map <Leader>rs :InterruptVimTmuxRunner<CR>
```

### Full Keybind Example

```viml
" Run the current file with rspec
map <Leader>rb :call RunVimTmuxCommand("clear; rspec " . bufname("%"))<CR>

" Prompt for a command to run
map <Leader>rp :PromptVimTmuxCommand<CR>

" Run last command executed by RunVimTmuxCommand
map <Leader>rl :call RunLastVimTmuxCommand<CR>

" Inspect runner pane
map <Leader>ri :InspectVimTmuxRunner<CR>

" Close all other tmux panes in current window
map <Leader>rx :CloseVimTmuxWindows<CR>

" Interrupt any command running in the runner pane
map <Leader>rs :InterruptVimTmuxRunner<CR>
```

## Options

### VimuxHeight
Set the percent height of the runner pane opened by `RunVimTmuxCommand`.
**Default: `"20"`**

```viml
let VimuxHeight = "50"
```

## Todo

The features I would like to add in the near future.

* Add the ability to target any tmux session, window and pane
